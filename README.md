# Student Record Management System

---

## Overview
The Student Record Management System is a console-based application developed in the C programming language to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve student information. The project replaces traditional manual record keeping with a structured and automated system, improving accuracy, accessibility, and data organization.

---

## Concepts Used
- Singly Linked List  
- Dynamic Memory Allocation  
- Pointers and Structures  
- Structured Programming in C  

---

## Features
- Add new student records  
- Delete student records using roll number  
- Search for a student record  
- Display all student records  
- Menu-driven command-line interface  

---

## Working Principle
The system uses a singly linked list where each node represents a student record containing details such as roll number, name, and academic performance. Nodes are dynamically allocated in memory, allowing flexible insertion and deletion without shifting data. Operations such as search, delete, and display traverse the linked list to locate and process the required records efficiently.

---

## Technologies Used
- C Programming Language  
- Standard C Libraries (stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h)  

---

## How to Run
1. Compile the program:
   gcc student_record.c -o student_record
2. Run the executable:
   ./student_record

---

## Learning Outcome
This project helps in understanding linked lists, pointer manipulation, dynamic memory management, and how data structures are used to solve real-world record management problems.
